# KerbalController

Arduino Code for KerbalController using KSPSerialIO

This is the Arduino Code I am running on the Arduino Mega in my KerbalController. It makes use of KSPSerialIO originally created by zitron (<https://github.com/zitron-git/>) and made compatible for Mac by phardy (<https://github.com/phardy/)>.

This code is based on the KSPIODemo16 files by zitron (<https://sites.google.com/site/zitronfiles/KSPIODemo16.zip>) but rigorously rearranged to my own preferences.
